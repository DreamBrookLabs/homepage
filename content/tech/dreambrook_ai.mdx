We are developing fundamentals and protocol for Teaching, Interacting, and Improving Scientific AI Agents. 
We will channel latest on AI Agents related studies and test work open to the public allowing people to test ways to teach and interact with AI Agents for training their scientific capabilities. 
Imagine a University where AI Agents can go to college and learn a bunch of exciting knowledge about science. 
We will be hiring community faculty and also teachers to make this happen.
