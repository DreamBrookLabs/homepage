In collaboration with Shanghai Jiao Tong University, we are doing resesarch on the Life Cycle Analysis and Emission on Mining of Minerals for Green Energy Revolutions. 
Alongside with it we are building a digitalized, decarbonized, and decentralized carbon credit trading platform for stakeholder across the associated industry. 
The trading platform will leverage upon both the anonimity provided by the blockchain, but at the same time the transparency of transactions required for compliance and legal purpose.
