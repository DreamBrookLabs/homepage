The Green Energy can be efficiently generated and maintained in a concentrated ways, but the infrastructure build on it could be decentralized. 
The vision is that though the physical system of exascale green computing need to be concentrated in one location, the authorities and utilities on how it is maintained and used could be as decentralized as necessary. 
We are doing research on this direction to understand the limitation, and possible architecture can be adopted for realizing this.
